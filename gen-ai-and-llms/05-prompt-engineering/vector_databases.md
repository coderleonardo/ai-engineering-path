# Vector Databases

Vector Databases are systems designed to store vectors.

In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, we typically store high-dimensional representations of objects in these databases, such as images, texts, or complex information, via embeddings.

This form of storage is efficient because it enables:

- Representing our data in a multidimensional space

- Similarity search capabilities

- Efficient indexing of large data volumes, increasing search speed
